### Link Finder

### nmap2searchsploit

A small helper that turns Nmap XML output into **useful SearchSploit queries**.

It exists because `searchsploit --nmap` is noisy and often searches generic service names instead of the actual **software + version** you care about. This tool pulls product/version data from Nmap and lets you run clean, targeted searches, with optional fallback logic when you want to widen the net.
